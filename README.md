# GGJ 2025 @ FEUP by NCGM Project

This project was developed during the Global Game Jam 2025 at FEUP, organized by Núcleo de Computação Gráfica e Multimédia, by André Ávila, Tiago Ribeiro and Tomás Carmo.

## Game Description

This is a game about living in a bubble, literally!
Manage resources inside each of your bubble colonies and make sure they don't pop.
Merge bubbles to bring out the best of each one, but careful! Sometimes the resources produced by the colonies are not enough to sustain the joined population of Space Dinos.
Upgrade buildings, respond to random events and become the best Space Dino colony on this side of the galaxy!
